# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The Prework Study Guide Webpage was created as an online place to collect notes on the subjects I learned about during the Prework portion of coding bootcamp. It contains my personal notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. It serves as a reference to things I learned, as well as being a visual representation of my new knowledge and skills.

## Installation

## Usage

To use the Prework Study Guide Webpage, read through the notes in each section. Use Chrome DevTools by right clicking and selecting Inspect, or pressing Command+Option+I (macOS), or Control+Shift+I (Windows). Once a panel opens to the side of the browser, click on Console to read a list of subjects and receive a suggestion on what to study first.
